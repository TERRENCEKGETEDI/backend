üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
You will need the following software installed on your machine:

Visual Studio 2022 (with the ASP.NET and web development workload)

.NET 8 SDK

PostgreSQL

Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository

git clone (https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

Open the Project in Visual Studio

Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

Configure the Database Connection

Open the appsettings.json file.

Modify the DefaultConnection string to point to your local PostgreSQL instance. You may only need to change the Server name.

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=name_of_endpoint;Database=natesa-spiritsquad-db;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}

Run Database Migrations

This will create the database and the News table based on the code.

In Visual Studio, go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

Run the following commands:

Add-Migration "InitialCreate"
Update-Database

Run the Application

Press F5 or click the "Run" button in Visual Studio to launch the application.

The homepage will display the latest news.
